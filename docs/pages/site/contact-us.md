### I have a question! How should I contact you?
{:.show}
Contact us directly: info@zzzprojects.com

Whether you need more personal help to get started or you just wanted to give us your opinion on the library, we love to hear from you!

You can also find some answers on:

Make sure to include:

### I need a feature your library is  lacking. Can I recommend it?
If your project requests a feature we haven’t thought of, please let us know using our [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/zzzprojects/EntityFramework-Extensions/issues){:target="_blank"}

We will develop and implement it as soon as possible, sometimes the same day. You could also contact us directly:

- If you want a more personal answer
- If your question is not suited for the Issue Tracker

We will do our best to accommodate you.
